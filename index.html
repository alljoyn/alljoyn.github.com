      <h1>Welcome to the AllJoyn&#8482; Open Source Project!</h1>
      <p>AllJoyn was developed to enable secure, ad hoc, proximity-based communication networks. It allows devices to communicate with other devices around them in a simple, user friendly manner without having to access the cloud or use a centralized server. It was also designed to enable developers to easily integrate peer to peer communications into new and existing applications without having to deal with or understand all of the complexities of networking in a multi peer (and multi-transport) environment.</p>
      <p>To do that, AllJoyn is focused on solving complex communications barriers that exist to enabling true peer-to-peer communications:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Transparently managing device and service discovery</li>
        <li>Managing networking and message routing</li>
        <li>Providing a security framework for message authentication and encryption</li>
        <li>Providing simple APIs for the supported language bindings</li>
        <li>Designed to have minimal requirements on the host OS</li>
        <li>Designed to be hardware and radio technology agnostic</li>
      </ul>
