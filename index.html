<h1><img src="img/ajn75.png" alt="AllJoyn Logo - ">Welcome to the AllJoyn&#8482; Open Source Project!</h1>
<p>AllJoyn was developed to enable secure, ad hoc, proximity-based communication networks. It allows devices to communicate with other devices around them in a simple, user friendly manner without having to access the cloud or use a centralized server. It was also designed to enable developers to easily integrate peer to peer communications into new and existing applications without having to deal with or understand all of the complexities of networking in a multi peer (and multi-transport) environment.</p>
<p>To do that, AllJoyn is focused on solving complex communications barriers that exist to enabling true peer-to-peer communications:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Transparently managing device and service discovery</li>
  <li>Managing networking and message routing</li>
  <li>Providing a security framework for message authentication and encryption</li>
  <li>Providing simple APIs for the supported language bindings</li>
  <li>Designed to have minimal requirements on the host OS</li>
  <li>Designed to be hardware and radio technology agnostic</li>
</ul>

<h1>How To Download AllJoyn Source</h1>
<p>The AllJoyn source is currently composed of multiple git repositories and is being managed using the <a href="http://source.android.com/source/git-repo.html" target="_blank">repo</a> tool. These instructions describe how to download a copy of the AllJoyn source code using repo, but you can also <a href="http://github.com/alljoyn">browse the repositories directly</a> if you choose; however we suggest using repo if you want to work with the code. To learn how to submit source changes to the AllJoyn OSP, please see the <a href="contribute.html">contribution instructions</a>, and read the <a href="http://www.alljoyn.org/contribute">AllJoyn.org contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
<h2>On Linux</h2>
<h3>Login to a bash shell window on a Linux system</h3>
<h3>Make sure that Python and git are installed</h3>
<p>We suggest that the Python version is 2.6 or greater and that the git version is 1.7 or greater. This can be checked as follows:</p>

<span style="font-family:courier new;">
<blockquote>
  $ python -V<br>
  $ git --version
</blockquote></span>


<p>If not, install or update them using your system pkg manager, or see your friendly sysadmin.</p>
<h3>Make sure repo's shell script is installed and in your PATH</h3>
<p>This can be done by issuing the repo command:  </p>
<blockquote>


<span style="font-family:courier new;">
  <p>$ repo </p></span>
</blockquote>
<p>If you get an error then choose a location you can write to and which is in your PATH (e.g. $HOME/bin or /usr/local/bin), and install repo there as follows: </p>
<span style="font-family:courier new;">
<blockquote>
  <p>  $ curl http://android.git.kernel.org/repo &gt; $HOME/bin/repo<br>
    $ chmod a+x $HOME/bin/repo
  </p>
</blockquote></span>


<h3>Download AllJoyn source into a new location</h3>


<span style="font-family:courier new;">
<blockquote>
  <p>  $ mkdir $HOME/alljoyn # or whatever directory name takes your fancy<br>
    $ cd $HOME/alljoyn<br>
    $ repo init -u git://github.com/alljoyn/manifest.git
  <br>
    $ repo sync <br>
    $ repo start master --all 
  </p>
</blockquote></span>


<h3>Update the AllJoyn source in that location at any time...</h3>
<p>... by running <span style="font-family:courier new;">repo sync</span> again.</p>

<h2>Using Cygwin on Windows</h2>
<p>On Windows, we suggest using Cygwin 1.7. If you do not already have git and repo working in an existing Cygwin environment, we suggest installing a clean copy of Cygwin 1.7; even if you already have Cygwin installed. It will not hurt to install another copy of Cygwin in a different location to try out git and repo. Once they are working there, you can try installing them in your existing Cygwin environment. </p>
<h3><a name="cygwim" id="cygwim"></a>Install Cygwin-1.7 </h3>
<p>Run <a href="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe" target="_blank">Cygwin setup.exe</a> from <a href="http://cygwin.com/" target="_blank">cygwin.com</a>. Take the defaults except where noted below:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Enter a new location      for the root directory, like <span style="font-family:courier new;">C:\AllJoyn\Cygwin\root</span> </li>
  <li>Enter a new location      for package directory, like <span style="font-family:courier new;">C:\AllJoyn\Cygwin\pkg </span></li>
  <li>Select Cygwin packages <span style="font-family:courier new;">git, python, curl,</span> and rebase for installation, in addition      to the default packages. <strong>Make sure your favorite editor is also      selected.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>RECOMMENDED:</strong> un-check the boxes for Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="shell" id="shell"></a>Install Repo's shell script</h3>
<p>Open a bash shell window by double-clicking <span style="font-family:courier new;">C:\AllJoyn\Cygwin\root\Cygwin.bat</span> in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>  Edit your .bash_profile and make the following changes (or similar):</p>

<span style="font-family:courier new;">
<blockquote>
  <p>  27,30c27,28
  <br>
  &lt; # Set PATH so it includes the user's private bin if it exists<br>
  &lt; # if [ -d &quot;${HOME}/bin&quot; ] ; then
  <br>
  &lt; # PATH=${HOME}/bin:${PATH}<br>
  &lt; # fi<br>
    ---<br>
  &gt; # Reset PATH so it includes user's private bin and excludes most Windows programs<br>
  &gt; PATH=&quot;${HOME}/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/cygdrive/c/Windows/system32:/cygdrive/c/Windows&quot;
  </p>
</blockquote></span>


<p>Create a private bin and install repo's shell script there:</p>
<span style="font-family:courier new;">
<blockquote>
  <p>  $ mkdir $HOME/bin<br>
    $ curl http://android.git.kernel.org/repo &gt; $HOME/bin/repo<br>
    $ chmod a+x $HOME/bin/repo
  </p>
</blockquote></span>


<p><strong>Close (</strong><span style="font-family:courier new;">exit</span><strong>) this bash window before proceeding!</strong></p>
<h3>Make sure that Python and git are installed</h3>
<p>We suggest that the Python version is 2.6 or greater and that the git version is 1.7 or greater. This can be checked by opening a new bash shell window (by double-clicking <span style="font-family:courier new;">C:\AllJoyn\Cygwin\root\Cygwin.bat</span> in Windows Explorer) and typing:</p>

<span style="font-family:courier new;">
<blockquote>
  <p>  $ python -V
    <br />
  $ git --version </p>
</blockquote></span>


<p>If those are not the installed versions or are missing, review <a href="#cygwin">Install Cygwin-1.7</a>.</p>
<h3>Make sure repo's shell script is in your PATH</h3>
<p>This can be done by typing: </p>

<span style="font-family:courier new;">
<blockquote>
  <p> $ repo </p>
</blockquote></span>
<p>If it is missing review <a href="#shell">Install Repo's shell script</a>.</p>
<h3>Download AllJoyn into a new location</h3>


<span style="font-family:courier new;">
<blockquote>
  <p>  $ mkdir $HOME/alljoyn # for example<br>
    $ cd $HOME/alljoyn<br>
    $ repo init -u git://github.com/alljoyn/manifest.git
  <br>
    $ repo sync <br>
    $ repo start master --all 
  </p>
</blockquote></span>



<p>If repo init throws an error message such as the following,</p>


<span style="font-family:courier new;">
<p>1 main python 2016 C:\AllJoyn\Cygwin\root\bin\python.exe: *** fatal error - unable to remap \\?\C:\AllJoyn\Cygwin\root\lib\python2.6\lib-dynload\time.dll to same address as parent: 0x380000 != 0x410000 </p></span>
<p>then you will have to <strong>rebase:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Close all open Cygwin bash shell windows</li>
  <li>Open a Windows CMD window, cd to bin under your Cygwin root directory, and run <strong>rebaseall</strong> (using <strong>ash</strong>, not <strong>bash</strong>): </li>
</ul>

<span style="font-family:courier new;">
<blockquote><p>cd C:\AllJoyn\Cygwin\root\bin<br />
.\ash.exe<br />
/bin/rebaseall<br />
exit </p>
</blockquote></span>


<ul>
  <li>Open a new bash shell window and re-try the above repo commands. You should not need to <strong>rebase</strong> again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Update AllJoyn source in that location at any time...</h3>
<p>... by running<span style="font-family:courier new;"> repo sync </span>again.</p>
<h3>Remove temp/test Cygwin installation when finished</h3>
<p><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> If you installed an additional, temporary copy of Cygwin to test Git and Repo, you can remove it at any time by removing the Cygwin root and package directories created at installation (C:\AllJoyn\Cygwin\root and C:\AllJoyn\Cygwin\pkg in the above example). Close any bash shell windows and remove the directories from Windows Explorer. If you un-install Cygwin from Windows' <strong>Programs</strong> tool, it may affect your existing copy of Cygwin. </p>

<h2>More on git and repo </h2>
<p>We probably don&rsquo;t need to describe git here, but for the sake of completeness: git is an open-source version-control system designed to handle large, distributed software projects. The AllJoyn source code is maintained in five separate Git repositories. We use git for local operations within individual git repositories, such as commits, diffs, and edits. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  git: <a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Repo is an open-source tool built on top of git. The Android project uses repo to help manage the many git repositories that contain their source code. We use repo in much the same way. Repo is not meant to replace git, only to make git easier to work with for projects using multiple repositories. For example, with a single repo command you can download the source code from all five AllJoyn git repositories. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  repo: <a href="http://source.android.com/source/git-repo.html">http://source.android.com/source/git-repo.html</a></p>
